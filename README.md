ECO-reader
==========

This reader implementation uses [OpenCv](http://opencv.org) to detect a laser line projected on a physical object 
to determine its shape. It shall be used for realtime audio playback/resynthesis, but is as valid for 3D scanning purposes â€“ 
given that the object is spinning.

**This is a work in progress and is not ready for production**
*In-depth description coming soon.*

See the [Ex Caelis Oblata](http://excaelisoblata.tumblr.com/) project for more information on how I'm planning to use this.
